= fluttersrc

Like my https://github.com/IanDarwin/javasrc[javasrc repo], this is intended to be a catchall for various Flutter demos.

Each folder is a separate project, in which you can "flutter run" or open in Android Studio.

* apple_looker - some Cupertino looking
* expenses-nativeview - Show an Android view in a Flutter app
* expenses-provider - example of Provider state mgmt
* flutter_state - another state demo
* l10n_counter_way1 - the I18N demo done "the first way" as per my deck
* random_image - pick a random resonably-nice image
* stack_rounded 0 modern page look, culled down to simplicity
