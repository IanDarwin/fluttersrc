= expenses-nativeview

A simple app for tracking expenses and submitting them to your HR department for reimbursement or tracking.

This uses a PlatformView (not a full Android Activity) to show the Expenses Detail/Edit form, and that part is currently only written for Android.

== Getting Started

Just run the app and follow the prompts :-)  Seriously,
this is not a production app yet by any means.

USE AT OWN RISK.

== I18N

This project generates localized messages based on arb files found in
the `lib/src/localization` directory.

To support additional languages, please visit the tutorial on
https://flutter.dev/docs/development/accessibility-and-localization/internationalization[
Internationalizing Flutter apps].
