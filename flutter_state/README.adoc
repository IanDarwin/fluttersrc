= flutter_state

This is a variant of the Counter demo done over using various state-management APIs:

* Provider
* BLoC
* (Others welcome, via Pull Request - TIA!)

The project is a bit unorthodox in having more than one main program, but you can just
run whichever main you want to demonstrate.
This isn't meant to be deployed to production devices, so it doesn't seem a problem.
When trying them out, keep a close eye on the run switcher beside the run button
to be sure you're running the right demo.
I've also color coded the app bar:

* Purple for Provider
* Blue for Bloc

The examples are similar to the canonical Counter app whose data model is a single int,
but the techniques extrapolate fairly directly to more complex models
like a List<Customer> or List<AnyThing>.

Enjoy!
