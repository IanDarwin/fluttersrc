= Random Image

A Flutter App for Android, iOS, etc., to grab random images from picsum

== PicSum?

A site that collects random photos off the internet, most of them not half-bad,
and makes them available.

*I can make no assertions about the copyright status of pictures used by this app*
since they are all provided by PicSum.

== History

This project started when Twitter user "AJ" @ItsmeAjayKV
asked ChatGPT a request like "write a program with two buttons in different colors,
both to grab a random image from the Internet."

Their result, slightly tweaked, is at https://dartpad.dev/?id=8710c98dbd5e642a3349ae5129e5ba90

That was the starting point of this code.

It's been altered a lot since; you can compare, if you dare, or even if you care.
