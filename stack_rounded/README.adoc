= stack_rounded

A Flutter project showing a radiused box,
common in this year's layouts, and some
radiused containers.

"Sandy Lion" is a trademark of Rejminet Group only
as applied to the lion image used in this app.
SandyLion (one word) stickers, which our kids loved
when they were young, were formerly made by a company of that name
at https://sandylion.com. That company has either renamed or been absorbed into
Trends International (https://trendsinternational.com/)
and they're not even marketing stickers under that name,
according to a search on their web site.

== TODO

Add GestureDetectors around the two rounded
containers, with various pop-ups.

Animated background gradient.
